# info.xml

Every CiviCRM [extension](/extensions/index.md) must have an `info.xml` file within it to provide information about the extension. This page is a reference for the schema of the `info.xml` file.

Typically, you'll begin by running [civix generate:module](/extensions/civix#generate-module) and `civix` will create a basic `info.xml` file for you. Use this page to learn how to customize that file.

## Example

Here is an example of a full `info.xml` file from [CiviVolunteer](https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.volunteer/blob/master/info.xml).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<extension key="org.civicrm.volunteer" type="module">
  <file>volunteer</file>
  <name>CiviVolunteer</name>
  <description>The CiviVolunteer extension provides tools for signing up, managing, and tracking volunteers.</description>

## Changelog

| CiviCRM Version | Description |
| -- | -- |
| 4.7.27 | Added [`<requires>`](#requires) and [`<ext>`](#ext) | 
| 4.5 | [`<develStage>`](#develStage) is not always required; when using civicrm.org's automated release management, this value is inferred from the version; for manual or private releases, the field should still be defined.
| 4.2 | Most extensions should be packaged as generic *module* rather than type-specific extensions.
| 4.2 | [`<downloadUrl>`](#downloadUrl) is optional for ordinary development; when using civicrm.org to distribute extensions, the [`<downloadUrl>`](#downloadUrl) will be specified when announcing the release on the website
| 4.2 | [`<downloadUrl>`](#downloadUrl) can point to auto-generated zipballs on Github.com
| 4.2 | Introduce stable support for generic modules.
| 4.1 | Introduce experimental extension-type for generic modules.
| 3.3 | Introduce extension-types for payment-processors, report-templates, and custom-searches.

!!! tip "Legacy extensions: Payment, Report, Search"
      Historically, CiviCRM v3.x-4.1 strictly categorized extensions as "Payment", "Report", or "Search" -- which required additional XML tags. These have been phased out during the 4.x cycle, and they are no longer documented here. For archival documentation, see [CRMDOC46: Extension Reference](https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC46/Extension+Reference).

      </requires>
    </extension>
    ```
    
* Notes:
    * For example if `org.civicrm.foo` requires `org.civicrm.bar`, then CiviCRM core will not enable `org.civicrm.foo` unless it can enable `org.civicrm.bar` _first_.
    * Also, if `org.civicrm.bar` depends on other extensions, the process will continue recursively, always by enabling the dependencies first. 
    * **CiviCRM core does not _download_ the dependencies** &mdash; it only *enables* them. The *user* must first download the dependencies. 
    * Currently, `<requires>` is only for managing dependencies on other *extensions* (not other libraries).
